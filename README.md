# SECRET SANTA

IF you are running a Secret Santa draw in your workplace and need a means of pairing the gifts between sender and receiver, then this is the tool for you. 
It is a command-line, Node.js script which is run like this:

```
node secretsanta.js Rita Sue Bob "Alan Sugar"
```

i.e. you supply a list people on the command-line and the script will produce a list of whose present is destinted for whom, without paper and guaranteeing
then a sender can't receive his/her own present.

## Installation

Download the repository, run "npm install" and the run the script.

Merry Christmas.
